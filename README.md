This repository contains ChucK code by Charlie Kramer. These are files I've mostly written for live performance. The first word of the file indicates what it does (roughly); Drum, Bass, Sample, Effect, Melody. Some of it is designed to make very weird noises :) and some of the code may require an external MIDI device or OSC input.
